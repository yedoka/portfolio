      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-200">About Me</h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-200">
        I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom, and also, coincidentally, a front-end developer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-200">My Philosophy</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-200">
        Knowledge is like a salad—good for you, but everyone keeps tossing in their opinions about what belongs in it. 
        And just when you think you’ve mastered the recipe, someone shows up with croutons of quantum mechanics.

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-200">My Background</h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-200">
        As a kid, I wasn’t just “good with computers”—I was that kid in the family. You know, the one who magically fixed the Wi-Fi by turning the router off and on (as if that wasn’t the only trick I knew). 
        My big claim to fame? Deleting my dad’s desktop icons because I thought they were &quot;cluttering the screen.&quot; Spoiler: He didn’t agree. 
        I once tried to hack into something top secret (or so I thought)—turns out, I just reset my mom’s email password. Still counts as hacking, right? 
        And then there were the PowerPoint presentations. Let’s just say I thought every transition deserved sound effects. My friends called it &quot;overkill&quot;; I called it art. 
        At some point, I realized my obsession with tinkering, troubleshooting, and occasionally breaking tech wasn’t just a phase. 
        So, I decided to turn my curiosity into a skillset—and this time, I promise I won’t delete anyone’s icons.
